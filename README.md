# ECommerce SQL Management System

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of an E-Commerce Website Management System developed by Rohit Akole. The system is designed to manage an online shopping platform where customers can purchase clothing, electronics, and related accessories from the comfort of their homes. The repository includes the database design, SQL scripts for Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations, and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrating the relationships between various entities within the system.

## Key Features:

* **Customer Management:** Handles customer information, including personal details, login credentials, and contact information.
* **Product Management:** Maintains details of products, including their categories, prices, and supplier information.
* **Order Management:** Manages customer orders, including order details, shipping information, and order tracking.
* **Supplier Management:** Stores information about suppliers and the products they supply.
* **Payment Processing:** Handles payment information for orders, including payment types and amounts.
* **Employee and Department Management:** Manages employee details, departmental information, salaries, and dependent details.

## SQL Scripts:

* **DDL.sql:** Script for creating the database schema and defining tables, constraints, and relationships.
* **DML.sql:** Script for populating the database with sample data and performing CRUD operations.
* **SQLdb.sql:** Additional SQL queries for advanced database operations and data retrieval.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

* The ERD provides a visual representation of the database structure, showing the relationships between entities such as Customers, Products, Orders, Suppliers, Employees, and more.

## Example Queries:

* Retrieve customers with only clothing purchases.
* List products supplied by each supplier.
* Find employees with salaries over $15,000 per month.
* Identify customers who order at least twice a week.

## Conclusion

This repository is a comprehensive resource for understanding the design and implementation of a robust e-commerce website management system using SQL. It serves as a valuable reference for database design, SQL programming, and e-commerce application development.
